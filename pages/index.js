        <h2>Who is the Sick Pay Solidarity Collective?</h2>
        <p>
          The Sick Pay Solidarity Collective are workers who want universal paid
          sick days. Until we get them, we created this fund to support our
          community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though many of us are part of many different organizations with
          diverse social justice goals, the aim of this particular constellation
          of people is to create immediate relief for any workers facing
          financial instability and who lack paid sick days, all while the
          battle for permanent and universal sick leave is being waged.

              This fund is for anyone who needs to call in sick to work, but is
              worried about the financial risk. We will not require
              documentation of your workplace, but trust that those accessing
              the fund are in need of immediate support.

            <p>
              We are aiming to be fast at processing the requests. The delay
              depends on how much money we receive, when we can process your
              request, and how urgently you say you need your money. We are
              hoping for between 2-5 days for each request, and we will try our
              best to be as fast as possible.

              This fund cannot remove the need for mandated paid sick days for
              all workers being becoming part of policy. The fight for paid sick
              days in Ontario has been an ongoing effort by activists for
              decades. You can support their work right now by taking action,
              signing petitions and contacting your MPPs, and checking out more
