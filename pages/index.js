            Who is the Sick Pay Solidarity Collective?
          </h2>
          <p className="">
            The Sick Pay Solidarity Collective are workers who want universal
            paid sick days. Until we get them, we created this fund to support
            our community.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            Though many of us are part of many different organizations with
            diverse social justice goals, the aim of this particular
            constellation of people is to create immediate relief for any
            workers facing financial instability and who lack paid sick days,
            all while the battle for permanent and universal sick leave is being
            waged.

                is worried about the financial risk. We will not require
                documentation of your workplace, but trust that those accessing

                We are aiming to be fast at processing the requests. The delay

                request, and how urgently you say you need your money. We are
                hoping for between 2-5 days for each request, and we will try
                our best to be as fast as possible.

                decades. You can support their work right now by taking action,
                signing petitions and contacting your MPPs, and checking out
